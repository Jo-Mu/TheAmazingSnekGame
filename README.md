# The Amazing Snek Game
A C++ snake game 2-player functionality built utilizing the Chili Direct X Framework

Game logic itself and visuals by me while the Engine was made by ChiliTomatoNoodle http://www.planetchili.net/

Overview
===============
*Press "Enter" to start the game or "2" to start a 2-player game.

*Single-Player controls with WASD or arrow keys

*In 2-Player

    -Player 1, starting on left side, controls with WASD
   
    -Player 2, starting on right, controls with arrow keys
   
*Collect yellow squares to grow

*A player loses when they either hit the wall, an obstacle, the body of the other player, or collide head on with the other player while they are smaller (in the case they are the same siz it's a tie)

TODO(Future Feature Ideas)
==================================
*Add a clickable menu at the start screen to select single or 2-player...... when I learn how to do that.

*Oh you thought the obstacles were bad now? Well the next I'll add LASERS to target players who survive long enough!
